# Inconsistency_Emulator
Dynamic emulator for estimating global mean climate responses to Stratosperic Aerosol Injection. The basic emulator is the emulator as appears in the paper. To conserve file sizes, all values that would be opimized in the base code are instead set to their final optimized values. Downloading only the Basic_Emulator directory allows one to run the emulator without needing to download any climate data.

Climate data used for paper figures and optimizers found in the Climate_Data directory. Paper can be found at DOI:10.22541/essoar.170785861.15326368/v1.

Repository will eventually be updated to include the optimizer and the full form of the emulator once we solve issues surrounding the file size of uploads to GitHub.
