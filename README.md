# Inconsistency_Emulator
Dynamic emulator for estimating global mean climate responses to Stratosperic Aerosol Injection. The basic emulator is the emulator as appears in the paper. To conserve file sizes, all values that would be opimized in the base code are instead set to their final optimized values.

Repository will eventually be updated to include the optimizer once we solve issues surrounding the file size of uploads to GitHub.
